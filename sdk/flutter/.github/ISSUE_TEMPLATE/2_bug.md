## Steps to Reproduce

<summary>Code sample</summary>

<!--
      Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
      and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

      To create it you can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

      Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
      which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.

      Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
      we regretfully will have to close it.
